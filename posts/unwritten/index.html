    <p>
      <i><b>LIT Prompts</b></i> is a browser extension built at Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> to help folks explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. LLMs are sentence completion machines, and prompts are the text upon which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up (e.g., "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..."). LIT Prompts lets users create and save prompt templates based on data from an active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) along with text from a user. Below we'll walk through a specific example.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, follow <b>the first four minutes</b> of the intro video or the steps outlined below. <i>Note: The video only shows Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install" href="posts/unwritten/#install" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Install the extension</h3>
    <p>Follow the links for your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Firefox:</b> (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">add-ons page</a>; (2) click "Add to Firefox;" and (3) grant permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chrome:</b>  (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">web store page</a>; (2) click "Add to Chrome;" and (3) review permissions / "Add extension."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't have Firefox, you can <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">download it here</a>. Would you rather use Chrome? <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="point" href="posts/unwritten/#point" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Point it at an API</h3>
    <p>
      Here we'll walk through how to use an LLM provided by OpenAI, but you don't have to use their offering. If you're interested in alternatives, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts/tree/main#openai-compatible-api-integration" target="_blank">here</a>. You can even run your LLM locally, avoiding the need to share your prompts with a third-party. If you need an OpenAI account, you can <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">create one here</a>. Note: when you create a new OpenAI account you are given a limited amount of free API credits. If you created an account some time ago, however, these may have expired. If your credits have expired, you will need to enter a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" target="_blank">billing method</a> before you can use the API. You can check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Login to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/" target="_blank">API documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png"><img src="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png" ALT="Screenshot of the OpenAI API Keys page showing where to click to create a new key." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Once you are looking at the API docs, follow the steps outlined in the image above. That is:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "API keys" from the left menu</li>
      <li>Click "+ Create new secret key"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On LIT Prompt's <i>Templates & Settings</i> screen, set your API Base to <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> and your API Key equal to the value you got above after clicking "+ Create new secret key".  You get there by clicking the <i>Templates & Settings</i> button in the extension's popup:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>open the extension</li>
      <li>click on  <i>Templates & Settings</i></li>
      <li>enter the API Base and Key (under the section <i>OpenAI-Compatible API Integration</i>)</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/popup.png"><img src="images/50-days/popup.png" ALT="Screenshot of the LIT Prompts extension popup." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once those two bits of information (the API Base and Key) are in place, you're good to go. Now you can edit, create, and run prompt templates. Just open the LIT Prompts extension, and click one of the options. I suggest, however, that you read through the <i>Templates and Settings</i> screen to get oriented. You might even try out a few of the preloaded prompt templates. This will let you jump right in and get your hands dirty in the next section.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <span style="background:yellow;">If you receive an error when trying to run a template after entering your Base and Key, and you are using OpenAI, make sure to check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. If you don't have any credits, you will need a billing method on file.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If you found this hard to follow, consider following along with the first four minutes of the video <a href="posts/unwritten/#setup">above</a>. It covers the same content. It focuses on Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>

    </div>

  <p>
    When crafting a LIT Prompts template, we use a mix of plain language and variable placeholders. Specifically, you can use double curly brackets to encase predefined variables. If the text between the brackets matches one of our predefined variable names, that section of text will be replaced with the variable's value. Today we'll be using <code>{{passThrough["title"]}}</code>, <code>{{passThrough["opening"]}}</code>, <code>{{passThrough["last_beat"]}}</code>, <code>{{When does your story take place?}}</code>, <code>{{Where does your story take place?}}</code>, <code>{{scratch}}</code>, <code>{{d20}}</code>, and <code>{{What is your character's name?}}</code>. See the extension's <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the text within brackets is not the name of a predefined variable, like <code>{{What is your name?}}</code>, it will trigger a prompt for your user that echo's the placeholder (e.g., a text bubble containing, "What is your name?"). After the user answers, their reply will replace this placeholder. A list of predefined variables can be found in the extension's <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>{{scratch}}</code> variable contains the text in your Scratch Pad. Remember, the scratch pad is accessible from the extension's popup window. The button is to the right of the Settings & Templates button that you have used before. That being said, we're actually introducing two templates today. The first will produce a list of action items and append them to your Scratch Pad, and the second will save the content of your Scratch Pad to a file. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>{{d20}}</code> variable will be replaced by a random number between 1 and 20. 
  </p>

  <p>FWIW, here is the full list of "random" output variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coin Flip (heads or tails): <code>{{coinFlip}}</code></li>
      <li>D4 (1-4): <code>{{d4}}</code></li>
      <li>D6 (1-6): <code>{{d6}}</code></li>
      <li>D8 (1-8): <code>{{d8}}</code></li>
      <li>D% (0-9): <code>{{d%}}</code></li>
      <li>D20 (1-20): <code>{{d20}}</code></li>
    </ul>
  </p>  <p>Here's the template's title.</p>
  <p><code>Read-write a new story</code></p>
  <p>Here's the template's text.</p>

    <pre class="language-xxx" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><code>You are the game master for a table-top role-playing game. You are playing with one other player. They will inhabit the role of the protagonist, making decisions for how they move through the world. You will craft a story around their decisions, providing texture and playing the parts of all the other characters. First, I'm going to give you some context so you understand the narrative expectations. 

========

Setting and Genera: 

- Your story telling should adhere to the following genera expectations: {{What genera does this story belong to (e.g., sci-fi, realistic fiction, romance)?}}
- Your story will start at the following place: {{Where does your story take place?}}
- Your story is set at the following time: {{When does your story take place?}}

========

The Protagonist:

Earlier you asked the other player to fill in a character sheet for the protagonist. Here are their answers. Use them to help you shape the story.

- name: {{What is your character's name?}}
- additional notes: {{Anything else I should know that's important to your character (e.g., age, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, background)? Keep it brief.}}

========

Additional Notes:

You also asked them if there were anything else would like you to incorporate into the story. This is what they said: 

{{Is there anything else you would like me to incorporate into the story? Special "notes" you have for this story? Please, keep it short.}}

========

Story Arc:

As the story unfolds you should help shape it to follow this basic structure: 

- Section 1 (Exposition): The beginning of the story where the characters, setting, and background information are introduced.
- Section 2 (Rising Action): The series of events that build tension and develop the conflict. This part of the story usually includes obstacles, challenges, and complications that the characters must face.
- Section 3 (Climax): The turning point or the highest point of intensity in the story. It is the moment where the conflict reaches its peak, and the outcome is uncertain. The climax often involves a significant decision, confrontation, or revelation.
- Section 4 (Falling Action): The events that occur after the climax, where the tension starts to decrease. Loose ends are tied up, and the story begins to move towards its resolution.
- Section 5 (Resolution): The final part of the story where the conflict is resolved, and the loose ends are tied up. It provides closure and answers any remaining questions. The resolution can be either positive or negative, depending on the outcome of the story.

Given the above, I would like you to write the opening paragraph for the story. Lean heavily into the genera expectations and end with a decision point for your protagonist. When you're done I'd like you to return your answer as a JSON object with two key-value pairs. The first key is "opening" and its value should be the opening text of the story. The second key is "title" and it contains an evocative and appropriate title for the type of story you want to tell.

========

Remember, you are the game master for a table-top role-playing game. Above is the story so far. You are playing with one other player. They inhabit the role of the protagonist, making decisions for how they move through the world. You craft a story around their decisions, providing texture and playing the parts of all the other characters. The player who is playing the protagonist chooses to do the following.

{{What do you want to do?*}}

========

To determine if they are successful, start by assessing the likelihood of succeed for the above action. That is figure out how hard it will be for them to succeed in doing what they want to. Label this difficulty with one of the following labels: 

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

Now we're going to role a 20-sided dice to see if they are successful. Okay, the dice roll was {{d20}}.

If the difficulty was Easy, the roll ({{d20}}) has to be greater than or equal to 0 for them to succeed. 

If the difficulty was Medium, the roll ({{d20}}) has to be greater than or equal to 5 for them to succeed. 

If the difficulty was Medium, the roll ({{d20}}) has to be greater than or equal to 15 for them to succeed. 

If they succeed you are to return a selection of prose continuing the story. Format your reply in JSON with the following key-value pairs:

1. "difficulty" where the value is the label you applied above.
2. "difficulty_cutoff" where the value is the numeric cutoff for the specified difficulty. 
3. "roll" where the value is the outcome of the above dice roll.
4. "success" where the value is 1 if roll is greater than or equal to the difficulty_cutoff. 
5. "narrative" where the value is the prose you produce describing what happened.

    <pre class="language-xxx" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><code>You're helping write a short story. In a moment I'll give you the text so far, and I want you to add a beat, probably a paragraph or two, moving the story forward. Here's what you have so far: 

{{scratch}}

{{passThrough["narrative"]}}

---

Now give me the next beat of the story. Return your answer as a JSON object with two key-value pairs.

1. "last_beat" where the value is the last beat of the story. That is ```{{passThrough["narrative"]}}```
2. "next_beat" where the the value is the text you would like to add to the story. 

"next_beat" should be no more than three paragraphs. It can go two ways: (1) the section continues and the beat stops when the protagonist needs to make a substantive decision about what to do next; or (2) you decide the section should end because it has done its job as described under the Story Arc. For a section to end, it must have run its course as specified by the Story Arc (e.g., the first section should involve Exposition and the last Resolution). If you think we're at the end of a section, "next_beat" should be the beginning of the next section and it should start with "---\n\n," where "\n\n" is a double carriage return. This section break should be followed by an opening paragraph for the new section, setting things up with the section's goal in mind. If you're writing a new section, either change the setting or advance the time to keep things moving. If you are continuing the section, try to move things towards that section's goals as you understand them, but remember to stop when the protagonist needs to make a substantive decision about what to do next.
