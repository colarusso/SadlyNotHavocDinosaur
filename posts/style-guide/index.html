  <p><i>This is <b>the 30th</b> post in my series <a href="posts/50-days-of-lit-prompts">50 Days of LIT Prompts</i></a>.</p>
  <p>
    Yes, this week's theme seems to be <a href="posts/magnify">talking to robot writing assistants while drinking coffee at a cafe</a>. Well, that and the idea that you should feed more words into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">large language model</a> (LLM) than you ask it to output. We do this to mitigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank">hallucinations</a> along with <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">other issues</a>. We will continue this approach with today's template, The Elements of Interactive Style Guides. Here's how it works, you highlight some text you want to "clean up," and it responds with suggestions based on a style guide provided by you. If you like, you can start a "conversation" to further refine your writing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's the text I want to clean up.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    In 1788 the King's advisers warned him that the nation was facing bankruptcy therefore he summoned a body called the States-General believing that it would authorize him to levy new taxes. The people of France however were suffering from burdensome taxation oppressive social injustice and acute scarcity of food and their representatives refused to consider projects of taxation until social and economic reforms should be granted. The King who did not realize the gravity of the situation tried to overawe them collecting soldiers in and about Versailles where the sessions were being held. The people of Paris seeing the danger organized militia companies to defend their representatives. In order to supply themselves with arms they attacked the Invalides and the Bastille which contained the principal supplies of arms and munitions in Paris.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Some of you may recognize this as an exercise from the 1920 edition of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm" target="_blank">The Elements of Style</a> by William Strunk, Jr. (which unlike the Strunk and White version is available on <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>).
  <p>
    What follows is output from today's template when fed the above text and the first six chapters of Strunk. This is followed by an ask from me and the LLM's reply. FWIW, the exercise above shows up in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm#Page_50" target="_blank">chapter seven</a>. So, it's inclusion in the prompt is only as the text we want to "clean up." That being said, it's all over the web. So, we can be sure it, and maybe some worked examples, are in our LLM's training data. You'll have to feed our template some original text to give it a proper test. And of course, you can use your own house style guide instead of The Elements of Style.
  </p>
  <iframe src="posts/style-guide/transcript.html" width="100%" height="350px"></iframe>

  <p>
    In my followup prompt, I asked the LLM to go ahead and make the edits. Interestingly, it only replaced in full four of it's six suggestions. The evaluation and <a href="posts/style-guide/#tires">improvement of the prompt template</a> is left as an exercise for the reader. ;)
  </p>
  <p>
    Below I'll show you how to put together the elements needed to create your own interactive style guide. That being said...

    <p>
      <i><b>LIT Prompts</b></i> is a browser extension built at Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> to help folks explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. LLMs are sentence completion machines, and prompts are the text upon which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up (e.g., "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..."). LIT Prompts lets users create and save prompt templates based on data from an active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) along with text from a user. Below we'll walk through a specific example.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, follow <b>the first four minutes</b> of the intro video or the steps outlined below. <i>Note: The video only shows Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install" href="posts/style-guide/#install" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Install the extension</h3>
    <p>Follow the links for your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Firefox:</b> (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">add-ons page</a>; (2) click "Add to Firefox;" and (3) grant permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chrome:</b>  (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">web store page</a>; (2) click "Add to Chrome;" and (3) review permissions / "Add extension."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't have Firefox, you can <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">download it here</a>. Would you rather use Chrome? <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="point" href="posts/style-guide/#point" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Point it at an API</h3>
    <p>
      Here we'll walk through how to use an LLM provided by OpenAI, but you don't have to use their offering. If you're interested in alternatives, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts/tree/main#openai-compatible-api-integration" target="_blank">here</a>. You can even run your LLM locally, avoiding the need to share your prompts with a third-party. If you need an OpenAI account, you can <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">create one here</a>. Note: when you create a new OpenAI account you are given a limited amount of free API credits. If you created an account some time ago, however, these may have expired. If your credits have expired, you will need to enter a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" target="_blank">billing method</a> before you can use the API. You can check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Login to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/" target="_blank">API documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png"><img src="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png" ALT="Screenshot of the OpenAI API Keys page showing where to click to create a new key." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Once you are looking at the API docs, follow the steps outlined in the image above. That is:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "API keys" from the left menu</li>
      <li>Click "+ Create new secret key"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On LIT Prompt's <i>Templates & Settings</i> screen, set your API Base to <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> and your API Key equal to the value you got above after clicking "+ Create new secret key".  You get there by clicking the <i>Templates & Settings</i> button in the extension's popup:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>open the extension</li>
      <li>click on  <i>Templates & Settings</i></li>
      <li>enter the API Base and Key (under the section <i>OpenAI-Compatible API Integration</i>)</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/popup.png"><img src="images/50-days/popup.png" ALT="Screenshot of the LIT Prompts extension popup." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once those two bits of information (the API Base and Key) are in place, you're good to go. Now you can edit, create, and run prompt templates. Just open the LIT Prompts extension, and click one of the options. I suggest, however, that you read through the <i>Templates and Settings</i> screen to get oriented. You might even try out a few of the preloaded prompt templates. This will let you jump right in and get your hands dirty in the next section.

    </div>
    <p>
      <span style="background:yellow;">If you receive an error when trying to run a template after entering your Base and Key, and you are using OpenAI, make sure to check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. If you don't have any credits, you will need a billing method on file.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If you found this hard to follow, consider following along with the first four minutes of the video <a href="posts/style-guide/#setup">above</a>. It covers the same content. It focuses on Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>

    When crafting a LIT Prompts template, we use a mix of plain language and variable placeholders. Specifically, you can use double curly brackets to encase predefined variables. If the text between the brackets matches one of our predefined variable names, that section of text will be replaced with the variable's value. Today we'll be using <code>{{passThrough}}</code> and <code>{{highlighted}}</code>. See the extension's <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>{{highlighted}}</code> variable contains any text you have highlighted/selected in the active browser tab when you open the extension. We use the Post-run Behavior parameter to govern what happens after a template is run. If you use Post-run Behavior to send one template's output to another template, the first template's output can be read by the second template via the <code>{{passThrough}}</code> variable. To make it easy for you to insert your own style guide: 
    <ol>
      <li>I created a template that provides writing feedback based on the content of the <code>{{passThrough}}</code> for a the text found in the <code>{{highlighted}}</code> variable when passed to an LLM.</li>
      <li>I created a template containing the text of the style guide, setting the Output Type to Prompt and the Post-Run Behavior to the name of the above template (i.e., "Generate feedback"), and checking the "Hide Button" checkbox. Note: I did it in this order so I could select the firt templates name as the post-run destination.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>



  <p>Here's the first template's title.</p>
  <p><code>Generate feedback</code></p>
  <p>Here's the template's text.</p>

  <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>LLM</code>. This choice means that we'll "run" the template through an LLM (i.e., this will ping an LLM and return a result). Alternatively, we could have chosen "Prompt," in which case the extension would return the text of the completed template. </li>
    <li><b>Model:</b> <code>gpt-4-turbo-preview</code>. This input specifies what model we should use when running the prompt. Available models differ based on your API provider. See e.g., <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models" target="_blank">OpenAI's list of models</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>0.7</code>. Temperature runs from 0 to 1 and specifies how "random" the answer should be. Here I'm using 0.7 because I'm happy to have the text be a little "creative."</li> 
    <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>1000</code>. This number specifies how long the reply can be. Tokens are chunks of text the model uses to do its thing. They don't quite match up with words but are close. 1 token is something like 3/4 of a word. Smaller token limits run faster.</li>
    <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
    <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Screen Only</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard... Here, we're content just to have it go to the screen.</li>
    <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>CHAT</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs. Here we want to be able to follow up with additional prompts. So, "CHAT" it is.</li>      <li><b>Hide Button:</b> <code>checked</code>. This determines if a button is displayed for this template in the extension's popup window. We've checked the option because this template shouldn't be triggered by the user directly. Rather, it needs to be triggered by another template so that there's something in the <code>{{passThrough}}</code> variable.</li>  </ul>

    <p>Here's the second template's title.</p>
    <p><code>The House Style Guide</code></p>
    <p>Here's the template's text.</p>

    <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>Prompt</code>. By choosing "Prompt" the template runs without being submitted to an LLM. It's output is just the template after slotting in variable values. </li>
      <li><b>Model:</b> <code>n/a</code>. Since Output Type is set to Prompt, we don't have to set LLM-specific parameters. </li>  
      <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>n/a</code>. Since Output Type is set to Prompt, we don't have to set LLM-specific parameters. </li>  
      <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>n/a</code>. Since Output Type is set to Prompt, we don't have to set LLM-specific parameters. </li>  
      <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
      <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Hidden</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard... Here, I've chosen the hide the output entirely. This is uesful when passing output to another template.</li> 
      <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>CHAT</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs.

<p>
  To work with the above templates, you could copy them and their parameters into LIT Prompts one by one, or you could download a single prompts file and upload it from the extension's <i>Templates &amp; Settings</i> screen. This will replace your existing prompts.

    It's one thing to read about something and another to put what you've learned into practice. Let's see how this template performs.

      <b>More exercise</b>. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm#Page_50" target="_blank">Chapter seven</a> contains more exersices. Why not give them a try? 
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Make it your own</b>. If you have your own style guide, replace The Elements of Style. You could also play with changing the instructions for how it should give advice. Maybe instead of having it suggest edits, you could have it simply flag issues and then you could engage in a back and forth over your suggested edits.

      <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜</a> by Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. There's a lot of history behind this paper. It was part of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/" target="_blank">a chain of events</a> that forced Timnit Gebru to leave Google where she was the co-lead of their ethical AI team, but more than that, it's one of the foundational papers in AI ethics, not to be confused with the field of "AI safety," which we will discuss later. It discusses several risks associated with large language models, including environmental/financial costs, biased language, lack of cultural nuance, misdirection of research, and potential for misinformation. If you want to engage critically with LLMs, this paper is a must read.

      The Elements of Style is a style guide for writing American English. It was originally written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918 and published in 1920. The book includes eight rules of usage, ten principles of composition, some matters of form, a list of commonly misused words and expressions, and a list of often misspelled words.
