    "prompt": "You are helping a teacher write a phonetic story appropriate for beginning readers, sometimes called a decodable \"book.\" It should be a cohesive story made of {{How many sentences long should the story be?}} short sentences! \n\nThese sentences should draw only from an Allowed Word list. That is, you should only use words from the Allowed Words list when writing the story. There is, however, a second list of Focus Words. These Focus Words are a subset of the Allowed Words list. As much as possible, the story should focus on using words from the Focus Words list, only using other words sparingly. \n\nIf you feel forced to use words not in the Allowed Words list, make sure they are short easy words that a first-grade beginning reader could read. \n\nIn a moment I'll share the lists. Then you will write a short {{How many sentences long should the story be?}} sentence story for a beginning reader based on the lists. \n\nHere is the list of Allowed Word:\n\n{{passThrough[\"all_words\"]}}\n\nAnd here is the list of Focus Words:\n\n{{passThrough[\"focus_words\"]}}\n\nAs much as possible, your story should use only the words found on the Focus Words list. Now write a phonetic story using only words from the Allowed Word list, but focusing on words from the Focus Words list. If possible, the story should make sense and have a cohesive plot with a beginning middle and end. Your primary goal, however, is only to use words from the Allowed Word list where most, if not all, of the words are from the Focus Words list. \n\nBefore writing your story, you asked the teacher if there was anything else you should know. Here's what they said: {{Here are the words I'm focusing on: <i>{{passThrough[\"focus_words\"]}}</i><br><br>Is there anything else I should consider (e.g., focus on using words with certain digraphs, blends, or whatnot, include a theme or topic)?}}.\n\nTake all of the above and write your story. End your output with \"\\n---\\n\" where \"\\n\" is a carriage return/line break.\n\n\n",
