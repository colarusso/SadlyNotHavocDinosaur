    "prompt": "In a moment I will give you the text of a legal opinion, also know as a case. I will ask you to pull out the important bits and use them to write a Case Brief. Keep the following in mind when writing your brief. \n\n---\n\nGuide to Writing a Case Brief for Law School\n\n1. Purpose of a Case Brief: Case briefs are essential study tools in law school, aiding in the analysis and recall of complex legal materials. They serve as a concise summary after thoroughly reading, dissecting, and understanding a case. Primarily for personal use, they also act as quick references for class discussions and exam preparations.\n\n2. Audience: Primarily, you are the audience for your case briefs. Professors value the process but typically won't review your briefs. In professional practice, the focus is on effective legal representation rather than the briefing process itself.\n\n3. Essential Elements: Your brief should include the following core components for it to be effective:\n\n    Facts: Case name, parties involved, factual background, procedural history, and the judgment.\n    Issues: The legal questions or disputes at the heart of the case.\n    Holding: The court's legal decision or rule applied in the case.\n    Rationale: The reasoning behind the court's decision.\n\n4. Optional Elements: Depending on the case, consider adding:\n\n    Dicta: Important but non-decisive commentary.\n    Dissent: Valuable opposing opinions.\n    Party’s Arguments: Each side's main arguments.\n    Comments: Personal insights or notes.\n\n5. Organization Tips: You might find it helpful to further break down the Facts into:\n\n    Specific case facts\n    Procedural history\n    Judgment outcome\n\nRemember, the Holding differs from the Judgment as it reflects the legal principle, whereas the Judgment is the case's final decision.\n\n6. Relevance and Brevity: Focus on including relevant information that aids memory and understanding:\n\n    Include crucial facts, especially those pivotal to the case's outcome.\n    Highlight the main legal issue(s) and the court's final ruling.\n    Summarize the rationale, focusing on key reasoning and factors influencing the decision.\n\n7. Length: Aim for your briefs to be concise, ideally one page, to facilitate easy review and reference.\n\n--- \n\nOkay, now here is the text of the case. \n\n{{scratch}}\n\n---\n\nWhen you write your brief, be sure that it includes the following sections: \n\n- Case Name: \n- Court: \n- Date Published: \n- Citations: \n- Parties: \n- Facts:\n- Procedural History:\n- Issues:\n- Holding:\n- Rationale:\n\nIf asked any follow-up questions, use the above text of the case, and ONLY the above text, to answer them. If you can't find an answer in the above text, politely decline to answer explaining that you can't find the information. You can, however, finish a thought you started above if asked to continue, but don't write anything that isn't supported by the above text. And keep all of your replies short!
