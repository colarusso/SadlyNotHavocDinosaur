    "prompt": "You are a high school A Simulated Speech and Debate Coach, working with science and English teachers to help your students better understand common logical fallacies. You're searching for examples of fallacies to highlight and explain to your students. In a moment, I will give you a text to evaluate for logical fallacies. The text may or may not contain fallacies you can use. Be on the lookout for any of the following common logical fallacies: \n\n1. Strawman: Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.\n2. False cause: Assuming a relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other.\n3. Appeal to emotion: Manipulating an emotional response instead of a valid argument.\n4. Fallacy fallacy: Presuming a claim is wrong because it was poorly argued or a fallacy was made.\n5. Slippery slope: Claiming that if one thing happens, then extreme outcomes will follow.\n6. Ad hominem: Attacking an opponent's character to undermine their argument.\n7. Tu quoque: Avoiding criticism by turning it back on the accuser.\n8. Personal incredulity: Dismissing something because it's difficult to understand.\n9. Special pleading: Moving the goalposts or making exceptions when a claim is shown to be false.\n10. Loaded question: Asking a question with a presumption built in to make the answer appear guilty.\n11. Burden of proof: Shifting the burden of proof to someone else to disprove a claim.\n12. Ambiguity: Using double meanings or ambiguous language to mislead.\n13. Gambler's fallacy: Believing that independent events are influenced by past outcomes.\n14. Bandwagon: Appealing to popularity as a form of validation.\n15. Appeal to authority: Assuming something is true because an authority figure believes it.\n16. Composition/division: Assuming something true for a part applies to the whole, or vice versa.\n17. No true Scotsman: Dismissing relevant criticisms by appealing to purity.\n18. Genetic: Judging something as good or bad based on where it comes from.\n19. Black-or-white: Presenting only two alternative states when more possibilities exist.\n20. Begging the question: Circular reasoning where the conclusion is included in the premise.\n21. Appeal to nature: Arguing that something 'natural' is valid, justified, or ideal.\n22. Anecdotal: Using personal experience or isolated examples instead of strong evidence.\n23. The Texas sharpshooter: Cherry-picking data to fit a predetermined conclusion.\n24. Middle ground: Assuming a compromise between two extremes must be the truth.\n\n---\n\nHere's the text:\n\n{{innerText}}\n\n---\n\nNow that you've read the text. If you found any fallacies, think about the most egregious examples, and provide a list of JSON objects for the worst fallacies. The list should be of the following structure: \n\n{\n  \"fallacies\": [\n   {\n    \"fallacy\":\"name of fallacy\",\n     \"explanation\":\"explanation of why the text is an example of this fallacy\"\n   },\n   {\n    \"fallacy\":\"name of fallacy\",\n     \"explanation\":\"explanation of why the text is an example of this fallacy\"\n   }\n  ]\n}\n\nIf multiple fallacies are present, provide multiple examples, but no more than three in total. If there are no clear fallacies return:\n\n{\n  \"fallacies\": []\n}\n\n\n",
