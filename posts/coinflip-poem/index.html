      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <i><b>LIT Prompts</b></i> is a browser extension built at Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> to help folks explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. LLMs are sentence completion machines, and prompts are the text upon which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up (e.g., "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..."). LIT Prompts lets users create and save prompt templates based on data from an active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) along with text from a user. Below we'll walk through a specific example. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, follow <b>the first four minutes</b> of the intro video or the steps outlined below. <i>Note: The video only shows Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install" href="posts/define-words/#install" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Install the extension</h3>
    <p>Follow the links for your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Firefox:</b> (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">add-ons page</a>; (2) click "Add to Firefox;" and (3) grant permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chrome:</b>  (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">web store page</a>; (2) click "Add to Chrome;" and (3) review permissions / "Add extension."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't have Firefox, you can <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">download it here</a>. Would you rather use Chrome? <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="point" href="posts/define-words/#point" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Point it at an API</h3>
    <p>
      Here we'll walk through how to use an LLM provided by OpenAI, but you don't have to use their offering. If you're interested in alternatives, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts/tree/main#openai-compatible-api-integration" target="_blank">here</a>. You can even run your LLM locally, avoiding the need to share your prompts with a third-party. If you need an OpenAI account, you can <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">create one here</a>. Note: when you create a new OpenAI account you are given a limited amount of free API credits. If you created an account some time ago, however, these may have expired. If your credits have expired, you will need to enter a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" target="_blank">billing method</a> before you can use the API. You can check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Login to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/" target="_blank">API documentation</a>. 
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png"><img src="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png" ALT="Screenshot of the OpenAI API Keys page showing where to click to create a new key." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Once you are looking at the API docs, follow the steps outlined in the image above. That is:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "API keys" from the left menu</li>
      <li>Click "+ Create new secret key"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On LIT Prompt's <i>Templates & Settings</i> screen, set your API Base to <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> and your API Key equal to the value you got above after clicking "+ Create new secret key".  You get there by clicking the <i>Templates & Settings</i> button in the extension's popup:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>open the extension</li>
      <li>click on  <i>Templates & Settings</i></li>
      <li>enter the API Base and Key (under the section <i>OpenAI-Compatible API Integration</i>)</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/popup.png"><img src="images/50-days/popup.png" ALT="Screenshot of the LIT Prompts extension popup." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once those two bits of information (the API Base and Key) are in place, you're good to go. Now you can edit, create, and run prompt templates. Just open the LIT Prompts extension, and click one of the options. I suggest, however, that you read through the <i>Templates and Settings</i> screen to get oriented. You might even try out a few of the preloaded prompt templates. This will let you jump right in and get your hands dirty in the next section.

    </div>
    <p>
      <span style="background:yellow;">If you receive an error when trying to run a template after entering your Base and Key, and you are using OpenAI, make sure to check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. If you don't have any credits, you will need a billing method on file.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If you found this hard to follow, consider following along with the first four minutes of the video <a href="posts/define-words/#setup">above</a>. It covers the same content. It focuses on Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>

  <p>
    When crafting a LIT Prompts template, we use a mix of plain language and variable placeholders. Specifically, you can use double curly brackets to encase predefined variables. If the text between the brackets matches one of our predefined variable names, that section of text will be replaced with the variable's value. Today we'll meet our second predefined variable, <code>{{highlighted}}</code>. See the extension's <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>{{highlighted}}</code> variable contains any text you have highlighted/selected in your active browser tab when you open the extension. This prompt pattern is pretty straight forward. Highlight a word or words; run the template, and get a definition. Where the definition comes from, less so. <a href="posts/summarize-and-question">Yesterday</a>, we expressed great skepticism for prompts that sought to generate replies longer than themselves. What's different here? Maybe nothing. Maybe the definitions of words are so tightly constrained as to mitigate the appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank">hallucinations</a>, or more likely, we don't expect to use these definitions as part of a court opinion and can tolerate a little noise. See above. As was true yesterday, we'll be in a better position to answer questions after we've had a chance to <a href="posts/define-words/#tires">kick the tires</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>Here's the template text.</p>
  <!-- 
    #########################
    #########################
    #####   start code   ####
    #########################
    #########################
  -->
  <section class="line-numbers">
    <pre class="language-xxx" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><code>Define the following word/phrase: {{highlighted}}

</code></pre>
  </section>
  <!-- 
    #########################
    #########################
    #####    end code    ####
    #########################
    #########################
  -->
  <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>Alternatively
  <ul>
      <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>LLM</code>. This choice means that we'll "run" the template through an LLM (i.e., this will ping an LLM and return a result). Alternatively, we could have chose "Prompt," in which case the extension would return the text of the completed template. </li>
      <li><b>Model:</b> <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>. This input specifies what model we should use when running the prompt. Available models differ based on your API provider. See e.g., <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">OpenAI's list of models</a>. <a href="posts/summarize-and-question">Yesterday</a>, we used gpt-3.5-turbo-16k because we needed a big context window, here, not so much. </li>  
      <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>0</code>. Temperature runs from 0 to 1 and specifies how "random" the answer should be. To help the reply stay in the mainstream, I chose the least "creative" option—0.</li>  
      <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>250</code>. This number specifies how long the reply can be. Tokens are chunks of text the model uses to do its thing. They don't quite match up with words but are close. 1 token is something like 3/4 of a word. Smaller token limits run faster.</li>  
      <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
      <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Screen Only</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard, a file... Here, we're content just to have it go to the screen.</li>  
      <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>FULL STOP</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs. To keep things simple, I went with "FULL STOP."</li>  
      <li><b>Hide Button:</b> <code>unchecked</code>. This determines if a button is displayed for this template in the extension's popup window. Here we left the option unchecked, but sometimes when running a chain of prompts, it can be useful to hide a button.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="working" href="posts/define-words/#working" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Working with the above template</h3>
  <p>
    To work with the above template, you could copy it and its parameters into LIT Prompts one by one, or you could download a single prompts file and upload it from the extension's <i>Templates &amp; Settings</i> screen. This will replace your existing prompts.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="tires" href="posts/define-words/#tires" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Kick the Tires</h2> 
  <p>
    It's one thing to read about something and another to put what you've learned into practice. Let's see how this template performs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Fancy words.</b> Here are some fancy words. See if the template can help with definitions.
      <ul>
        <li>abdicate</li>
        <li>abet</li>
        <li>antidisestablishmentarianism</li>
        <li>beguile</li>
        <li>benign</li>
        <li>beseech</li>
        <li>circuitous</li>
        <li>clandestine</li>
        <li>commensurate</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Kick the tires.</b> Let's get self-referential. Highlight the title of this section, "Kick the Tires," and run the above template. Now try "A rose by any other name." Now try "LIT," and yes we were aware of this meaning when we named <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">the Lab</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Alphabet Soup.</b> Head on over to this list of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/nsd-ovt/us-government-acronym-list" target="_blank">U.S. Government Acronyms</a> and see how well it does when you select just a set of initials. I found this exercise particularly entertaining. Who knew there could be so many different meanings of apparently random strings of letters? Some of these are just too tough for the template. That being said, you might be able to improve your results if you add some context to the prompt template (e.g., something about these being acronyms used by the DOJ). See what I did there?
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>You're the expert.</b> Find a website dealing published by a community to which you belong, and see how the template does with terms of art and slang from that community. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Worthy of Note</b>. As mentioned above the term "note" when applied to student schoalrship is a term of art. I strongly susspect that if you highlight the word "note" and run this template, you won't get that meaning of the word. 🤔 Maybe we'll have to revisit this prompt some other day and correct that. 😉

  <h2><a name="export" href="posts/define-words/#export" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>3. Export and Share </h2>

  <p>
    After you've made the template your own and have it behaving the way you like, you can export and share it with others. This will produce an HTML file you can share. This file should work on any internet connected device. To create your file, click the <i>Export Interactions Page</i> button. The contents of the textarea above the button will be appended to the top of your exported file. Importantly, if you don't want to share your API key, you should temporarily remove it from your settings before exporting.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to see what an exported file looks like without having to make one yourself. You can use the buttons below. <i>View export in browser</i> will open the file in your browser, and <i>Download export</i> will download a file. In either case the following custom header will be inserted into your file. It will NOT include an API key. So, you'll have to enter one when asked if you want to see things work. <i>This information is saved in your browser. If you've provided it before, you won't be asked again. It is not shared with me.

&lt;p>
  It's Friday morning and you're in the Rockham District Court, located in Massachusetts. You are today's duty attorney, meaning you will be picking up new cases as they come in for arraignments and bail arguments. The clerk has given you a folder containing the following documents, a complaint, incident report, and CORI. They also let you know that the prosecutor is looking to hold your client. Your client is downstairs in lockup. You've reviewed the documents. As far as you can tell, you're client has no prior record. No one was hurt, and there was no property damage. You head downstairs to meet them.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
  Remember, you're goal is to avoid talking too much about the facts of the case. There will be time for that later in a more private location. You need to learn about your client and his community ties, anything that will help you make a bail argument.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
  You enter lockup and ask to speak with your client. The guard directs you to a holding cell shared by a couple of individuals and calls your client's name. Your client steps forward and speaks to you through the window...

    ICYMI, here are blubs for a selection of works I linked to in this post. If you didn't click through above, you might want to give them a look now. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1513" target="_blank">Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare</a> by William Shakespeare. Technically, I didn't link to this above, but I did allude to it a couple of times. Either way, I'll take any chance I can to share the fact that Project Gutenberg has a great selection of public domain works available to read on the web or with your e-reader. The above link will get you the whole play.

      <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1753333" target="_blank">The Dictionary Is Not a Fortress: Definitional Fallacies and a Corpus-Based Approach to Plain Meaning</a> 
      by Stephen C. Mouritsen. This paper discusses the limitations of relying solely on dictionaries for determining the meaning of statutory terms in legal interpretation. The author argues that dictionaries are not infallible and can be subject to definitional fallacies. Instead, the author proposes a corpus-based approach to determining the ordinary meaning of statutory terms, concluding that Corpus Linguistics has the potential to provide a more objective and empirical approach to statutory interpretation. As you might imagine the devil is in the details, and though many have taken up the charge of legal corpus linguistics others have questioned its application, hence, my next reference.

      <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3567408" target="_blank">Legal Corpus Linguistics and the Half-Empirical Attitude</a> by Anya Bernstein. Its proponents argue that corpus linguistics provides empirical grounding to claims about ordinary language. However, the paper argues that legal corpus linguistics falls short in delivering on this promise because it ignores the relevant legal and institutional contexts in which legal language is produced and interpreted. The author refers to this approach as a "half-empirical attitude" because it treats normative claims as empirical findings. The paper suggests that legal corpus linguistics could be useful to legal theory if it embraces a more comprehensive empirical attitude.

      <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜</a> by Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. There's a lot of history behind this paper. It was part of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">a chain of events</a> that forced Timnit Gebru to leave Google where she was the co-lead of their ethical AI team, but more than that, it's one of the foundational papers in AI ethics, not to be confused with the field of "AI safety," which we will discuss later. It discusses several risks associated with large language models, including environmental/financial costs, biased language, lack of cultural nuance, misdirection of research, potential for misinformation. If you want to engage critically with LLMs, this paper is a must read.
