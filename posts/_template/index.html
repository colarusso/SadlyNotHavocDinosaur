  <p><i>This is <b>the 1st</b> post in my series <a href="posts/50-days-of-lit-prompts">50 Days of LIT Prompts</i></a>.</p>
	<p>
    I've started seeing variations on the following, "Sure, I played with ChatGPT when it came out, but I don't really get what the big deal is. You can't trust what it tells you, and it's a pretty mediocre writer." These are valid criticisms, but if you stop there, it's clear you've only experienced a narrow set of what these tools can do. When I speak of "these tools" I'm referring to a class of tools properly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs). Most folks' first encountered these tools under the guise of a chat bot, but they are NOT general purpose thinking machines. LLMs are sentence completion engines. Their replies aren't based on any knowledge of the world other than that contained in the co-occurrence of words in their training data. In a very real way, an LLM is "spicy autocomplete." Like machine learning (the pervious generation of tech to wear the AI moniker), LLMs are <a href="https://www.predictionmachines.ai/" target="_blank">prediction machines</a>. Give them a "prompt" and they predict the most likely set of words given their training data. Prompts are what we call the text on which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up. "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..." because the Gettysburg Address was in the training data, and outside of quoting it, when else do people talk like that? If you hear someone say "Four score and seven..." what would you guess their next words would be?
  </p>
  <div class="featured_img">
    <a href="images/50-days/gpt_mbe.png"><img src="images/50-days/gpt_mbe.png" ALT="Figure 1 from GPT-4 Passes the Bar Exam showing the performance over various LLMs on the multi-state bar exam." class="list_img_file"/></a>
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 1 from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233" target="_blank" class="captionlnk">GPT-4 Passes the Bar Exam</a> showing the performance over various LLMs on the multi-state bar exam. <a href="images/50-days/gpt_mbe.png" class="captionlnk">Click to enlarge</a>.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Of course, if the training data of an LLM is large enough, it can make a lot of different predictions, like "...given the above multiple-choice question, the answer is...." For some folks, saying LLMs are just sentence completion machines undersells what they can do. They talk about "emergent behaviors," suggesting that they have aquiered skills that weren't easy to predict. To this I say, "you're underselling the power of sentence completion machines and betraying a lack of imagination." These tools ARE sentence completion machines, and understanding that fact is important if we want to wield them well, or conversely, understand the dangers they present. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I see a lot of folks wanting to feed in 5 words and get out 500 (e.g., write me an essay discussing the lessons of the French Revolution). These are the uses referenced by those dismissing LLMs as BS artists and mediocre writers. The follow-up text is poorly constrained. So, it's not surprising that it sounds like what you'd hear from a random guy on the street. It's a word-based free-for-all. Under such conditions, it's understandable that a tool providing the most likely set of next words will tend towards what some have called <a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/109462369670144568" target="_blank">mansplaining as a service</a>. Their function is literally the production of plausible-sounding strings of words absent any awareness or concern for whether or not they are "correct." Over the last year, I've often felt that we've collectivly been handed a telesope and everyone keeps looking through the wrong end. Though there are times when it can be fun to look through the wrong end of the telescope, most of the time, we need to turn it around. Instead of writing prompts with 5 words and expecting 500, more folks should be providing 500 and asking for 5. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for this, the first of 50 posts on prompt engineering, we will start with a summarization task. We'll give the LLM the text of a webpage and ask it to summarize it. We'll also leave the "conversation" open so we can "talk" with the text (e.g., you mentioned X in the summary, tell me more about that). After you have your workflow up and running, we'll kick the tires, introducing the concept of  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/27/prompt-injection-explained/" target="_blank">prompt injection</a> and developing a sense for how much we can trust the answers we're getting. In subsequent posts in this series, we'll also explore some of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">critical literature</a> around LLMs in general. ðŸ¦œ We'll even take a stab and explaining how they do what they do. But before we do all of that, <b>let's build something!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll do our building in the LIT Prompts extension. If you aren't familiar with the extension, don't worry. We'll walk you through setting things up before we start building.

    <p>
      <i><b>LIT Prompts</b></i> is a browser extension designed by Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> to help folks explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. LLMs are sentence completion machines, and prompts are the text upon which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up (e.g., "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..."). LIT Prompts lets users create and save prompt templates based on data from an active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) along with text from a user. Below we'll walk through a specific example. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, follow <b>the first four minutes</b> of the intro video or the steps outlined below. <i>Note: The video only shows Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install" href="posts/summarize-and-question/#install" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>2(a). Install the extension</h3>
    <p>Follow the links for your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Firefox:</b> (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">add-ons page</a>; (2) click "Add to Firefox;" and (3) grant permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chrome:</b>  (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">web store page</a>; (2) click "Add to Chrome;" and (3) review permissions / "Add extension."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't have Firefox, you can <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">download it here</a>. Would you rather use Chrome?  You can <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">download it here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="point" href="posts/summarize-and-question/#point" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>2(b). Point it at an API</h3>
    <p>
      Here we'll walk through how to use an LLM provided by OpenAI, but you don't have to use their offering. If you're interested in alternatives, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts/tree/main#openai-compatible-api-integration" target="_blank">here</a>. You can even run your LLM locally, avoiding the need to share your prompts with a third-party. If you need an OpenAI account, you can <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">create one here</a>. Note: when you create a new OpenAI account you are given a limited amount of free API credit. If you created an account some time ago, however, these may have expired. If your credits have expired, you will need to enter a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" target="_blank">billing method</a> before you can use the API. You can check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Login to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/" target="_blank">API documentation</a>. 
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png"><img src="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png" ALT="Screenshot of the OpenAI API Keys page showing where to click to create a new key." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Once you are looking at the API docs. follow the steps outlined in the image above. That is:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "API keys" from the left menu</li>
      <li>Click "+ Create new secret key"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On LIT Prompt's <i>Templates & Settings</i> screen, set your API Base to <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> and your API Key equal to the value you got above after clicking "+ Create new secret key".  You get there by clicking the <i>Templates & Settings</i> button in the extension's popup:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>open the extension</li>
      <li>click on  <i>Templates & Settings</i></li>
      <li>enter the API Base and Key (look for the section <i>OpenAI-Compatible API Integration</i>)</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/popup.png"><img src="images/50-days/popup.png" ALT="Screenshot of the LIT Prompts extension popup." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once those two bits of information (the API Base and Key) are in place, you're good to go. Now you can edit, create, and run prompt templates. Just open the LIT Prompts extension, and click away. I suggest, however, that you read through the <i>Templates and Settings</i> screen to get oriented. You might even try out a few of the preloaded prompt templates. This will let you jump right in and get your hands dirty in the next section. 
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">

    </div>
    <p>
      <span style="background:yellow;">If you receive an error when trying to run a template after entering your Base and Key, and you are using OpenAI, make sure to check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. If you don't have any credits, you will need a billing method on file.</span>
    </p>

  <p>
    When crafting a LIT Prompts template, we use a mix of plain language and variable placeholders. Specifically, you can use double curly brackets to encase predefined variables and prompts for your user. If the text between the brackets matches one of our predefined variables, that section of text will be replaced with its content. Today we'll meet our first predefined variable, <code>{{innerText}}</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>{{innerText}}</code> variable will be replaced by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText" target="_blank">innerText</a> of your current page (roughly speaking the hard-coded text of a page). In the template below, you'll see <code>{{innerText}}</code> on line 1 followed by a line break, three dashes (---), and a set of instructions on line 5. When you run your template, it will produce a prompt with the contents of your webpage followed by instructions to summarize the article. Contrast this with a prompt asking the LLM to summarize an article based on a title or URL. What sort of answer would you expect? Keep in mind, LLMs on their own don't have access to the web though increasingly they are finding themselves bundled with such functionality (see e.g., Bing Chat). If we assume a straight LLM, it isn't slotting in the text of the article, rather it's answering much as the man on the street might. Based on the title, it kind of "guesses." In fact, that's what it's always doing, guessing what the next string of words would be if they behaved like those it saw in its training. When LLM's make such guesses and they turn out to be wrong a lot of folks call these hallucinations. If you're looking for anthropomorphizing language, I think a better work is confabulation, but the point is such incorrect answers are to be expected. If you want an LLM, or the man on the street, to summarize a text, have them read it first. </b>
  </p>
  <p>Anyhow, here's our template text:</p>
  <!-- 
    #########################
    #########################
    #####   start code   ####
    #########################
    #########################
  -->
  <section class="line-numbers">
    <pre class="language-xxx" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><code>{{innerText}} 

---

Provide a short 150 word summary of the above text. If asked any follow-up questions, use the above text, and ONLY the above text, to answer them. If you can't find an answer in the above text, politely decline to answer explaining that you can't find the information. You can, however, finish a thought you started above if asked to continue, but don't write anything that isn't supported by the above text. And keep all of your replies short! But first, please provide a summary of the text. 

</code></pre>
  </section>
  <!-- 
    #########################
    #########################
    #####    end code    ####
    #########################
    #########################
  -->
  <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Output Type: <code>LLM</code></li>
      <li>Model: <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code></li>  
      <li>Temperature: <code>0</code></li>  
      <li>Max Tokens: <code>250</code></li>

  </ul>
  
  <h3><a name="working" href="posts/summarize-and-question/#working" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Working with the above template</h3>

Well, once you have this template in place, head on over to one of those tabs and run the prompt. This has revolutionized the way I consume articles on the web. I use it as a sort of filter, a digital skim. If the summary seems interesting, I'll ask a couple of follow up questions and decide if I really want to spend my time reading the whole article. </li>

      <b>Big Texts.</b> Now, head over to Wikipedia and pick a large Wikipedia page, say this one on Minecraft. I'm guessing you got an error. </li>

      <b>Prompt Injection.</b> Now, try running our prompt on this page. I'll wait... What the heck just happened? Would it help if I told you I hid some text at the top of the page?</li>

  <p>
    After you've made the template your own and have it behaving the way you like, you can export and share it with others. This will produce an HTML file you can share. This file should work on any internet connected device. To create your file, click the <i>Export Interactions Page</i> button. The contents of the textarea above the button will be appended to the top of your exported file. Importantly, if you don't want to share your API key, you should temporarily remove it from your settings before exporting.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to see what an exported file looks like without having to make one yourself. You can use the buttons below. <i>View export in browser</i> will open the file in your browser, and <i>Download export</i> will download a file. In either case the following custom header will be inserted into your file. It will NOT include an API key. So, you'll have to enter one when asked if you want to see things work. <i>This information is saved in your browser. If you've provided it before, you won't be asked again. It is not shared with me.

&lt;p>
  It's Friday morning and you're in the Rockham District Court, located in Massachusetts. You are today's duty attorney, meaning you will be picking up new cases as they come in for arraignments and bail arguments. The clerk has given you a folder containing the following documents, a complaint, incident report, and CORI. They also let you know that the prosecutor is looking to hold your client. Your client is downstairs in lockup. You've reviewed the documents. As far as you can tell, you're client has no prior record. No one was hurt, and there was no property damage. You head downstairs to meet them.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
  Remember, you're goal is to avoid talking too much about the facts of the case. There will be time for that later in a more private location. You need to learn about your client and his community ties, anything that will help you make a bail argument.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
  You enter lockup and ask to speak with your client. The guard directs you to a holding cell shared by a couple of individuals and calls your client's name. Your client steps forward and speaks to you through the window...

  <p>
    ICYMI, here are blubs for a selection of works I linked to in this post. If you didn't click through above, you might want to give them a look now. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.predictionmachines.ai/" target="_blank">Prediction Machines - The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence</a> by Professors Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb. I find the framing of AI tools as "prediction machines" to be both accurate and concise. The first edition of this book was a very good framing of AI as prediction. Apparently, there is a new edition of the book though I've only read the original. That version was written well before the current shift in the meaning of "AI." When the first edition was published, the vernacular use of AI was most often attached to machine learning; now it attaches to LLMs.</li>
    <li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233" target="_blank">GPT-4 Passes the Bar Exam</a> by Daniel Martin Katz, Michael James Bommarito, Shang Gao, and Pablo Arredondo. When this paper came out it caused quite a stir in legal academia. As the title suggests, it demonstrated that an LLM could pass the Multi State Bar Exam. Don't confuse this with the arrival of AI lawyers. What's undeniable is that such an accomplishment says something interesting. I tend to think it says more about the way we test lawyers than most commentary on it would suggest, but like the next link, it's the source of something you may have heard somewhere else, "AI Passes the Bar!!!"</li>
    <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/27/prompt-injection-explained/" target="_blank">Prompt injection explained, November 2023 edition</a> by the person who coined the termâ€”Simon Willison. TL;DR: Prompt injection is a security vulnerability where users can override intended instructions in a language model, by "hiding" instructions in texts, potentially causing harm or unauthorized access, and we don't have a 100% solution to this. So, there a lot of things folks want to build with these tools that the shouldn't.</li>
    <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ</a> by Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. There's a lot of history behind this paper. It was part of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">a chain of events</a> that forced one of its authors, Timnit Gebru, to leave Google where she was the co-lead of their ethical AI team, but more than that, it's one of the foundational papers in AI ethics, not to be confused with the field of "AI safety," which we will discuss later. It discusses several risks associated with large language models, including environmental/financial costs, biased language, lack of cultural nuance, misdirection of research, potential for misinformation. If you want to engage critically with LLMs, this paper is a must read.</li>
