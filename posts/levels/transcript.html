        <div id="output_window"><div class="text_wrap" id="text_1"><div class="output_text" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1) The New York Times (NYT) is fighting a lawsuit with OpenAI, a tech company. NYT says OpenAI's program copies their articles. But OpenAI says that NYT is wrong, and they didn't do anything bad.

2) OpenAI, a tech company, is currently disputing a copyright lawsuit filed by The New York Times (NYT). NYT alleges that OpenAI's language model, which uses AI to generate text, is infringing on their copyright by creating similar versions of their articles. OpenAI, however, argues that they aren't responsible for possible copyright violations because their program is just a tool that people can use in different ways. They say it's like blaming a car company for a bad driver. They also say that the NYT had to manipulate their system a lot to get it to produce content similar to their articles.

3) OpenAI has filed a motion to dismiss the current copyright lawsuit brought against them by The New York Times (NYT). The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI's language model, GPT-3, infringes on NYT's copyright by generating very similar versions of their articles. However, OpenAI argues that any liability should fall on the user, or 'prompter', who manipulates the system to produce potentially copyright-infringing works, likening it to blaming a car company for a driver's reckless actions. They also highlight that the Times had to exploit a bug and use deceptive prompts violating OpenAI's terms of use to achieve the contentious outputs. OpenAI asserts that the claims in NYT's complaint do not meet its well-known journalistic standards, arguing that the copyright law exists to control the dissemination of works in the marketplace and not to grant authors absolute control over all uses of their works. They also make a fair use argument, noting that the non-consumptive use of copyrighted material is protected by the doctrine.</div></div></div>
