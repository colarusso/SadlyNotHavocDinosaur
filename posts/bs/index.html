  <p><i>This is <b>the 34th</b> post in my series <a href="posts/50-days-of-lit-prompts">50 Days of LIT Prompts</i></a>.</p>

  <p>
    I hope folks are adding these daily templates to a growing list of LIT Prompts. I find myself reaching for various prompt templates throughout the day. That being said, today we cover a template that really should be in your collection. You may have thought to add it yourself, or it may have been so obvious that you overlooked it. I'm talking about a template for chatting with an LLM. That's right, your very on generic Chatbot. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's almost too simple, but I genuinely find it useful to have access to an LLM from the browser without the need to open ChatGPT or the like. Hopefully, you do too. That being said, I'd be remiss if I didn't provide context for today's title. So, before we jump into making something, here's an expanded excerpt from the piece I <a href="posts/devils-advocate">quoted yesterday</a>. 
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The modern authoritarian practice of “flood[ing] the zone with shit” clearly illustrates the dangers posed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit#Harry_Frankfurt's_concept" target="_blank">bullshitters</a>—i.e., those who produce plausible sounding speech with no regard for accuracy. Consequently, the broad-based concern expressed over the rise of algorithmic bullshit is both understandable and warranted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models" target="_blank">Large language models</a> (LLMs), like those powering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, which complete text by predicting subsequent words based on patterns present in their training data are, if not the embodiment of such bullshitters, tools ripe for use by such actors. They are by design fixated on producing plausible sounding text, and since they lack understanding of their output, they cannot help but be unconcerned with accuracy. Couple this with the fact that their training texts encode the biases of their authors, and one can find themselves with what some have called <a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/109462369670144568" target="_blank">mansplaining as a service</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one, "algorithmic BS artists" lack agency. They do not understand their input or output. Their "dishonesty" is a consequence of their use case, not their character. Context matters, and tools are not moral actors. Any agency, moral or otherwise, lies with the developers and users of such tools. By stepping into these roles we can better explore the questions presented by their use. Additionally, as educators, it is part of our duty to prepare our students for the realities of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/" target="_blank">a world where such tools exist</a>. To do that we think it's important to understand, not just how they work now, but to explore new use cases. The tools presented here are, in part, an attempt to imagine pro-social uses for such technology, ones that don't result in the death of scholarship or truth. In fact, they are attempts to use them in service of both. Of course, any assessment of a tool's use must consider a broad context, including its creation. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-020-00405-8" target="_blank"></a>This raises a good many questions. Readers can find more discussion of these at <a href="https://www.codingthelaw.org" target="_blank">Coding The Law.org</a> and see an example of how we've responded to some of them in <a href="https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/trusts/" target="_blank">our prior AI work</a>. Below, however, we will focus on the tools found here on Find My Cite, which largely ask, "can we work with this particular 'bullshitter' (i.e., LLMs)?" 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since writing that, I've found a good number of readings to help people think about what it means to work with a BS artist. You can find some of them <a href="posts/bs/#references">below</a>. That being said...</p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <i><b>LIT Prompts</b></i> is a browser extension built at Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> to help folks explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. LLMs are sentence completion machines, and prompts are the text upon which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up (e.g., "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..."). LIT Prompts lets users create and save prompt templates based on data from an active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) along with text from a user. Below we'll walk through a specific example.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, follow <b>the first four minutes</b> of the intro video or the steps outlined below. <i>Note: The video only shows Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install" href="posts/bs/#install" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Install the extension</h3>
    <p>Follow the links for your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Firefox:</b> (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">add-ons page</a>; (2) click "Add to Firefox;" and (3) grant permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chrome:</b>  (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">web store page</a>; (2) click "Add to Chrome;" and (3) review permissions / "Add extension."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't have Firefox, you can <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">download it here</a>. Would you rather use Chrome? <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="point" href="posts/bs/#point" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Point it at an API</h3>
    <p>
      Here we'll walk through how to use an LLM provided by OpenAI, but you don't have to use their offering. If you're interested in alternatives, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts/tree/main#openai-compatible-api-integration" target="_blank">here</a>. You can even run your LLM locally, avoiding the need to share your prompts with a third-party. If you need an OpenAI account, you can <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">create one here</a>. Note: when you create a new OpenAI account you are given a limited amount of free API credits. If you created an account some time ago, however, these may have expired. If your credits have expired, you will need to enter a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" target="_blank">billing method</a> before you can use the API. You can check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Login to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/" target="_blank">API documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png"><img src="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png" ALT="Screenshot of the OpenAI API Keys page showing where to click to create a new key." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Once you are looking at the API docs, follow the steps outlined in the image above. That is:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "API keys" from the left menu</li>
      <li>Click "+ Create new secret key"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On LIT Prompt's <i>Templates & Settings</i> screen, set your API Base to <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> and your API Key equal to the value you got above after clicking "+ Create new secret key".  You get there by clicking the <i>Templates & Settings</i> button in the extension's popup:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>open the extension</li>
      <li>click on  <i>Templates & Settings</i></li>
      <li>enter the API Base and Key (under the section <i>OpenAI-Compatible API Integration</i>)</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/popup.png"><img src="images/50-days/popup.png" ALT="Screenshot of the LIT Prompts extension popup." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once those two bits of information (the API Base and Key) are in place, you're good to go. Now you can edit, create, and run prompt templates. Just open the LIT Prompts extension, and click one of the options. I suggest, however, that you read through the <i>Templates and Settings</i> screen to get oriented. You might even try out a few of the preloaded prompt templates. This will let you jump right in and get your hands dirty in the next section.

    </div>
    <p>
      <span style="background:yellow;">If you receive an error when trying to run a template after entering your Base and Key, and you are using OpenAI, make sure to check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. If you don't have any credits, you will need a billing method on file.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If you found this hard to follow, consider following along with the first four minutes of the video <a href="posts/bs/#setup">above</a>. It covers the same content. It focuses on Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>

  <p>
    When crafting a LIT Prompts template, we use a mix of plain language and variable placeholders. Specifically, you can use double curly brackets to encase predefined variables (e.g., <code>{{highlighted}}</code> grabs the highlighted text from your active browser window). If the text between the brackets matches one of our predefined variable names, that section of text will be replaced with the variable's value. If the text within brackets is not the name of a predefined variable, like <code>{{What is your name?}}</code>, it will trigger a prompt for your user that echo's the placeholder (e.g., a text bubble containing, "What is your name?"). After the user answers, their reply will replace this placeholder. Here we use it to get the conversation going by having the LLM open with "Yes?" A list of predefined variables can be found in the extension's <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>Here's today's template title.</p>
  <p><code>BS with a "bot"</code></p>
  <p>Here's the template's text.</p>
  <!--
    #########################
    #########################
    #####   start code   ####
    #########################
    #########################
  -->
  <section class="line-numbers">
    <pre class="language-xxx" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><code>{{Yes?}} [# {{Yes?}} isn't a predefined variable. So, the user will be presented with a text input, and since Post-run Behavior is set to CHAT, this ends up being a plain old chat with an LLM. #]
</code></pre>
  </section>
  <!--
    #########################
    #########################
    #####    end code    ####
    #########################
    #########################
  -->
  <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>LLM</code>. This choice means that we'll "run" the template through an LLM (i.e., this will ping an LLM and return a result). Alternatively, we could have chosen "Prompt," in which case the extension would return the text of the completed template. </li>
    <li><b>Model:</b> <code>gpt-4o-mini</code>. This input specifies what model we should use when running the prompt. Available models differ based on your API provider. See e.g., <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models" target="_blank">OpenAI's list of models</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>0.7</code>. Temperature runs from 0 to 1 and specifies how "random" the answer should be. Here I'm using 0.7 because I'm happy to have the text be a little "creative."</li> 
    <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>500</code>. This number specifies how long the reply can be. Tokens are chunks of text the model uses to do its thing. They don't quite match up with words but are close. 1 token is something like 3/4 of a word. Smaller token limits run faster.</li>
    <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
    <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Screen Only</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard... Here, we're content just to have it go to the screen.</li>
    <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>CHAT</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs. Here we want to be able to follow up with additional prompts. So, "CHAT" it is.</li>      <li><b>Hide Button:</b> <code>unchecked</code>. This determines if a button is displayed for this template in the extension's popup window. </li>  </ul>
<h3><a name="working" href="posts/bs/#working" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Working with the above template</h3>
<p>
  To work with the above template, you could copy it and its parameters into LIT Prompts one by one, or you could download a single prompts file and upload it from the extension's <i>Templates &amp; Settings</i> screen. This will replace your existing prompts.

    Here are blubs for a selection of works you should probably read before having too many chats with an LLM.</p>

Writing at the beginning of ChatGPT's rise to prominence, this article discusses the analogy between language models like ChatGPT and lossy compression algorithms. Chiang argues that while models can repackage/compress web information, they lack true understanding. Ultimately, Chiang concludes that starting with a blurry copy is not ideal when creating original content and that the struggling to express thoughts is an essential element of the writing process.

      This article explores the potential risks and consequences of artificial intelligence (A.I.) in relation to capitalism. Chiang suggests that A.I. can be seen as a management-consulting firm, similar to McKinsey & Company, which concentrates wealth and disempowers workers. He argues that A.I. currently assists capital at the expense of labor, and questions whether there is a way for A.I. to assist workers instead of management. Chiang also discusses the need for economic policies to distribute the benefits of technology appropriately, as well as the importance of critical self-examination by those building world-shaking technologies. He concludes by emphasizing the need to question the assumption that more technology is always better and to engage in the hard work of building a better world. <i>Summary based on a draft from our <a href="posts/summarize-and-question">day one template</a>.</i>

      Palmer discusses the ongoing information revolution and the impact of AI on society. She emphasizes that information revolutions have been a normal part of human life for centuries, and AI is just the latest iteration of this trend. Palmer argues that AI has the potential to democratize the power to create media, such as video games and movies, and enable more people to express themselves artistically. She acknowledges that AI may threaten certain livelihoods, but believes that thoughtful transitions and safety nets can help mitigate these challenges. Palmer also addresses concerns about fake news and propaganda, noting that society has always learned to combat the dangers of new media. She concludes by emphasizing the importance of policy and planning to ensure that the rollout of AI is beneficial for all.

Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. There's a lot of history behind this paper. It was part of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/" target="_blank">a chain of events</a> that forced Timnit Gebru to leave Google where she was the co-lead of their ethical AI team, but more than that, it's one of the foundational papers in AI ethics, not to be confused with the field of "AI safety," which we will discuss later. It discusses several risks associated with large language models, including environmental/financial costs, biased language, lack of cultural nuance, misdirection of research, and potential for misinformation. If you want to engage critically with LLMs, this paper is a must read.

      The article discusses the integration of decolonial theory into artificial intelligence (AI) to address ethical and societal impacts. It highlights the importance of critical science and post-colonial theories in understanding AI's role in modern societies, emphasizing the need for a decolonial approach to prevent harm to vulnerable populations. The paper proposes tactics for developing a decolonial AI, including creating a critical technical practice, seeking reverse tutelage, and renewing affective and political communities. These strategies aim to align AI research and technology development with ethical principles, centering on the well-being of all individuals, especially those most affected by technological advancements.
