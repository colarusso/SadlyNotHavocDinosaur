  <p><i>This is <b>the 37th</b> post in my series <a href="posts/50-days-of-lit-prompts">50 Days of LIT Prompts</i></a>.</p>

  <p>
    Do yourself a favor. Write down the books you've read. Otherwise, you'll find yourself wondering if that book looks familiar because you put it on a list to read or because you've read it already. Unfortunately, I've never had such a list. :( 
  </p>
  <p>
    So, today I created <a href="posts/archeology/#template">a set of LIT Prompts</a> to help me conduct some digital archeology. They extract and clean data from old emails and online histories. So far, today alone I've been able to reconstruct about ten years' worth of online book orders, resulting in a list of 400+ books. Eventually, I'll need to add physical books I didn't order online, but I can always consult my shelves and this seems less of a problem for such books. Anywho, once the templates were ready to go, the workflow looked like this.  
  </p>
  <h3><a name="workflow" href="posts/archeology/#workflow" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Extract &amp; Clean</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>See if you can <b>download a list of books</b> you've checked out or purchased from each of the places you get books. I found about 200 books this way, but this list only went back to 2017 and didn't cover all the places I get books.</li>
    <li><b>Run the <i>Clear scratch</i> template</b> described <a href="posts/archeology/#template">below</a>. This replaces the LIT Prompts' Scratch Pad with the header for a simple csv file (i.e., "title","author","read")</li>
    <li>For those book providers who didn't offer a downloadable csv, <b>navigate to the history section of your account, select all (ctr-A), and run the <i>Get book info from on-page reading history</i> template</b>. Navigate through the history page-by-page, selecting all and re-running the template. This will extract book names, authors, and dates from the page and add them as entries to the Scratch Pad in the form of a csv row. Note: I was able to do this with one of my library accounts, Amazon, and Audible though the current prompt didn't capture dates for Amazon's list. So, you might have to tweak things.</li>
    <li>For providers who didn't have online histories, <b>search for emails from telling you a book is available</b> (e.g., from:donotreply@library.example.com).</li>
    <li><b>Open each email in the above results, select all (ctr-A), and run the <i>Get book info from email</i> template</b>. This will extract book names, authors, and dates from the email and add them to the Sratch Pad in the form of a csv row. See animated GIF below.</li>
    <li><b>Clean up</b> the Scratch Pad to make sure the formatting is right (e.g., I had to add line breaks so each row was on a new line).</li>
    <li><b>Run the <i>Save to file</i> template</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Open the resulting spreadsheet and clean things up as needed</b> (e.g., some dates were clearly off as they were today's date). This is also where you can combine any csv files you got elsewhere.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="featured_img_center" style="max-width:636px;">
    <a href="images/50-days/get_book.gif"><img src="images/50-days/get_book.gif" ALT="Screenshot of step 5 in the above workflow." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>

  </div>

  <p>FWIW, here's a a partial list of what I found. Mostly, I filtered out the books I've read with my kids since that really seemed like their lists, and this list misses most of the physical books I've read, which honestly isn't that many these days. Also, you'll notice that the spreadsheet includes links where you can find the books (I added this manually). If you want to filter the entries, you'll need to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYeuhAl9Yqybz_3bYf6PxVXPmKIwJwBpx0c13sHPbNU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">open the sheet</a>.</p>

  <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQCMnK9pUk7vWIgNrfhILsm3RLOiSaeHDxP1X-EsxMbawSktpQ7dfDyVR58bb_xZ_eIs5s8UXp0F78Y/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="100%" height="350px"></iframe>

  <p>The <a href="posts/archeology/#template">prompt templates</a> are pretty straight forward. The real trick is setting things such that new data is appended to the Scratch Pad. Should you wish to go on your own digital dig, I wish you luck. Of course, this approach should be rather generalizable. So, don't feel like you have to stick to books. Maybe you want a nice structured list of other online histories... </p>

    <p>
      <i><b>LIT Prompts</b></i> is a browser extension built at Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> to help folks explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. LLMs are sentence completion machines, and prompts are the text upon which they build. Feed an LLM a prompt, and it will return a plausible-sounding follow-up (e.g., "Four score and seven..." might return "years ago our fathers brought forth..."). LIT Prompts lets users create and save prompt templates based on data from an active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) along with text from a user. Below we'll walk through a specific example.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, follow <b>the first four minutes</b> of the intro video or the steps outlined below. <i>Note: The video only shows Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install" href="posts/archeology/#install" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Install the extension</h3>
    <p>Follow the links for your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Firefox:</b> (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">add-ons page</a>; (2) click "Add to Firefox;" and (3) grant permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chrome:</b>  (1) visit the extension's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">web store page</a>; (2) click "Add to Chrome;" and (3) review permissions / "Add extension."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't have Firefox, you can <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">download it here</a>. Would you rather use Chrome? <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="point" href="posts/archeology/#point" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Point it at an API</h3>
    <p>
      Here we'll walk through how to use an LLM provided by OpenAI, but you don't have to use their offering. If you're interested in alternatives, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts/tree/main#openai-compatible-api-integration" target="_blank">here</a>. You can even run your LLM locally, avoiding the need to share your prompts with a third-party. If you need an OpenAI account, you can <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">create one here</a>. Note: when you create a new OpenAI account you are given a limited amount of free API credits. If you created an account some time ago, however, these may have expired. If your credits have expired, you will need to enter a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" target="_blank">billing method</a> before you can use the API. You can check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Login to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/" target="_blank">API documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png"><img src="images/50-days/OpenAI_keys.png" ALT="Screenshot of the OpenAI API Keys page showing where to click to create a new key." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Once you are looking at the API docs, follow the steps outlined in the image above. That is:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "API keys" from the left menu</li>
      <li>Click "+ Create new secret key"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On LIT Prompt's <i>Templates & Settings</i> screen, set your API Base to <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> and your API Key equal to the value you got above after clicking "+ Create new secret key".  You get there by clicking the <i>Templates & Settings</i> button in the extension's popup:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>open the extension</li>
      <li>click on  <i>Templates & Settings</i></li>
      <li>enter the API Base and Key (under the section <i>OpenAI-Compatible API Integration</i>)</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="featured_img_center">
      <a href="images/50-days/popup.png"><img src="images/50-days/popup.png" ALT="Screenshot of the LIT Prompts extension popup." class="list_img_file" style="border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once those two bits of information (the API Base and Key) are in place, you're good to go. Now you can edit, create, and run prompt templates. Just open the LIT Prompts extension, and click one of the options. I suggest, however, that you read through the <i>Templates and Settings</i> screen to get oriented. You might even try out a few of the preloaded prompt templates. This will let you jump right in and get your hands dirty in the next section.

    </div>
    <p>
      <span style="background:yellow;">If you receive an error when trying to run a template after entering your Base and Key, and you are using OpenAI, make sure to check the state of any credits <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank">here</a>. If you don't have any credits, you will need a billing method on file.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If you found this hard to follow, consider following along with the first four minutes of the video <a href="posts/archeology/#setup">above</a>. It covers the same content. It focuses on Firefox, but once you've installed the extension, the steps are the same.</i>

  <p>
    When crafting a LIT Prompts template, we use a mix of plain language and variable placeholders. Specifically, you can use double curly brackets to encase predefined variables. If the text between the brackets matches one of our predefined variable names, that section of text will be replaced with the variable's value. Today we'll be using <code>{{highlighted}}</code>, and <code>{{scratch}}</code>. See the extension's <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts#prompt-templates" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>{{highlighted}}</code> variable contains any text you have highlighted/selected in the active browser tab when you open the extension. We'll use this to select text on the scree from which to pull our data. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>{{scratch}}</code> variable contains the text in your Scratch Pad. Remember, the scratch pad is accessible from the extension's popup window. The button is to the right of the Settings & Templates button that you have used before. Here we use the fact that you can append things to the Scratch Pad to create our list of books before saving it to a file. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For a breakdown of how to use these templates, check out the workflow above: <a href="posts/archeology/#workflow">Extract & Clean</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Here's the first template's title.</p>
  <p><code>Clear scratch</code></p>
  <p>Here's the template's text.</p>
  <!--

    #########################

  <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>Prompt</code>. By choosing "Prompt" the template runs without being submitted to an LLM. It's output is just the template after slotting in variable values. </li>
     <li><b>Model:</b> <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>. This input specifies what model we should use when running the prompt. Available models differ based on your API provider. See e.g., <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models" target="_blank">OpenAI's list of models</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>0.7</code>. Temperature runs from 0 to 1 and specifies how "random" the answer should be. Here I'm using 0.7 because I'm happy to have the text be a little "creative."</li> 
    <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>250</code>. This number specifies how long the reply can be. Tokens are chunks of text the model uses to do its thing. They don't quite match up with words but are close. 1 token is something like 3/4 of a word. Smaller token limits run faster.</li>
    <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
    <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Screen + replace scratch pad</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard... Here, I've chosen the screen and replacing the the current text of the Scrtach Pad with this output.</li> 
    <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>FULL STOP</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs. To keep things simple, I went with "FULL STOP."</li>    <li><b>Hide Button:</b> <code>unchecked</code>. This determines if a button is displayed for this template in the extension's popup window. </li>  </ul>
  <p>Here's the second template's title.</p>
  <p><code>Get book info from email</code></p>

    <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>LLM</code>. This choice means that we'll "run" the template through an LLM (i.e., this will ping an LLM and return a result). Alternatively, we could have chosen "Prompt," in which case the extension would return the text of the completed template. </li>
    <li><b>Model:</b> <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>. This input specifies what model we should use when running the prompt. Available models differ based on your API provider. See e.g., <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models" target="_blank">OpenAI's list of models</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>0</code>. Temperature runs from 0 to 1 and specifies how "random" the answer should be. Since we're seeking fidelity to a text, I went with the least "creative" setting—0.</li>
    <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>250</code>. This number specifies how long the reply can be. Tokens are chunks of text the model uses to do its thing. They don't quite match up with words but are close. 1 token is something like 3/4 of a word. Smaller token limits run faster.</li>
    <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
    <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Screen + append to scratch pad</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard... Here, I've chosen the screen and appending the output to the end of the text already in the Scrtach Pad.</li> 
    <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>FULL STOP</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs. To keep things simple, I went with "FULL STOP."</li>    <li><b>Hide Button:</b> <code>unchecked</code>. This determines if a button is displayed for this template in the extension's popup window. </li>  </ul>
  <p>Here's the third template's title.</p>
  <p><code>Get book info from on-page reading history</code></p>
  <p>Here's the template's text.</p>

  <p>And here are the template's parameters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Output Type:</b> <code>Prompt</code>. By choosing "Prompt" the template runs without being submitted to an LLM. It's output is just the template after slotting in variable values. </li>
     <li><b>Model:</b> <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>. This input specifies what model we should use when running the prompt. Available models differ based on your API provider. See e.g., <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models" target="_blank">OpenAI's list of models</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> <code>0.7</code>. Temperature runs from 0 to 1 and specifies how "random" the answer should be. Here I'm using 0.7 because I'm happy to have the text be a little "creative."</li> 
    <li><b>Max Tokens:</b> <code>250</code>. This number specifies how long the reply can be. Tokens are chunks of text the model uses to do its thing. They don't quite match up with words but are close. 1 token is something like 3/4 of a word. Smaller token limits run faster.</li>
    <li><b>JSON:</b> <code>No</code>. This asks the model to output its answer in something called JSON. We don't need to worry about that here, hence the selection of "No."</li>  
    <li><b>Output To:</b> <code>Screen Only</code>. We can output the first reply from the LLM to a number of places, the screen, the clipboard... Here, we're content just to have it go to the screen.</li>
    <li><b>Post-run Behavior:</b> <code>SAVE TO FILE</code>. Like the choice of output, we can decide what to do after a template runs. Here we will save the output to a file. This will trigger your browser's download feature.</li>      <li><b>Hide Button:</b> <code>unchecked</code>. This determines if a button is displayed for this template in the extension's popup window. </li>  </ul>
