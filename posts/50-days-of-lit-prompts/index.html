	<meta property="og:description" content="Every weekday for the next 10 weeks, I'll update this page with new prompt patterns and invite folks to play with them inside LIT Prompts. We'll be plugging into the technology that runs tools like ChatGPT, giving you a level of control that most people don't see. You won't have to do any &quot;coding,&quot; but we will think like coders. I'm still suspicious of the term prompt engineering, esp. when used as a job title. The idea that an entire job could be built around &quot;talking&quot; to an AI seems a bit too loosey goosey. So, we'll try to introduce some rigor. We'll aim to think about workflows and systems where writing prompts is just part of a larger endeavor. You'll be supported by the fact that LIT Prompts lets you produce reusable interconnecting prompt templates. This will let us build upon what we learn and improve our practice over time. We'll explore the promise and perils of this new technology while you build custom interactions/workflows. Plus, I'm pretty sure we'll have fun along the way."/>

    As an <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/faculty/d/c/dcolarusso" target="_blank">experiential educator</a>, I firmly believe experience is an excellent teacher. So, let's build some stuff. In the process we might just gain some perspective on this whole generative AI craze.
  </p>
  <p>
    I teach law students about technology, and recently I created the <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts" target="_blank">LIT Prompts</a> browser extension to help them explore the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a>. You can download the extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lit-prompts/" target="_blank">for Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lit-prompts/hfeojjmldhebkeknfapoghcohkhffcmp" target="_blank">for Chrome</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Every weekday for the next 10 weeks, I'll update this page with new prompt patterns and invite folks to play with them inside LIT Prompts. We'll be plugging into the technology that runs tools like ChatGPT, giving you a level of control that most people don't see. You won't have to do any &quot;coding,&quot; but we will think like coders. I'm still suspicious of the term prompt engineering, esp. when used as a job title. The idea that an entire job could be built around &quot;talking&quot; to an AI seems a bit too loosey goosey. So, we'll try to introduce some rigor.
