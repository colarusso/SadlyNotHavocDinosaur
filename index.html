Much of the swirling blue and white night sky, dotted with bright yellow stars and a crescent moon, is already complete, while part of the village below remains unpainted, revealing the white canvas.

    My name is David Colarusso.<sup>&dagger;</sup> I founded and co-direct Suffolk University Law School's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation & Technology (LIT) Lab</a>. By training I'm an attorney & science educator. By experience, I'm a data scientist, craftsman, and writer. Mostly, I build things: furniture, software, reasoned arguments...
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, my work focuses on <a href="https://law.mit.edu/pub/unsupervised-machine-scoring-of-free-response-answers/release/1" target="_blank">NLP</a>/<a href="https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">AI</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/awbdx_v1" target="_blank">data standards</a>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3911381" target="_blank">document automation</a>, and increasing access to justice. I'm also interested in using games to power <a href="https://www.lawnext.com/2018/10/stanford-suffolk-create-game-help-drive-access-justice.html" target="_blank">crowdsourcing efforts</a> and <a href="https://lawrpg.org/" target="_blank">foster learning</a>. If I'm being cute, I might say I teach sand to "think" about the law and law students how to <a href="https://www.codingthelaw.org" target="_blank">work with</a> and <a href="https://lawrpg.org/2025/ai-and-the-law/" target="_blank">think about</a> "thinking" sand. 
    </p>
    <p>I <a href="https://www.davidcolarusso.com/cv/media_coverage/2005-05-30_article.htm" target="_blank">taught high school</a> physics & astronomy for six years before going to law school, five of those were in Lexington Massachusetts, with one in Edinburgh Scotland on a <a href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/lexington-minuteman/2007/08/23/exchange-teacher-returns-from-scotland/39108271007/" target="_blank">Fulbright teacher exchange</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>While teaching I produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it_Z7NdKgmY&list=PL305357ACC216006C&index=3" target="_blank">physics serise</a> on YouTube that did pretty well (over 7 million views). I also ran a small <a href="http://www.anaces.com/" target="_blank">software company</a>. The latter side hustle continued through law school—running for eight years and closing in the black.
    </p>
<p>
  After law school, I became a public defender and stayed with the agency for six years. As an attorney, I started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cJOyEgp5I" target="_blank">asking questions</a> about how we used data; this led to me making suggestions, and before long, I moved from my role as a line attorney to that of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/07/30/drug-war-is-creating-problems-too-big-to-fix/" target="_blank">data scientist</a>. I started freelance writing, took on some Suffolk Law students as interns, and began teaching there as an adjunct professor. In 2017, I left the defenders and joined Suffolk <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/faculty/d/c/dcolarusso" target="_blank">full-time</a> to start the Lab.

  <p>
    My "AI" hot take goes something like this. I am a contextual contrarian. If you are on the AI Hype Train™ I will try hard to derail you—pointing out the very real <a href="https://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2020/level/4/#intro_vid" target="_blank">dangers</a> people are facing in the here & now from "AI" tools. But if you dismiss the pro-social uses of "AI" out of hand, I'll point out where it can be used to <a href="https://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2020/level/9/#intro_vid" target="_blank">help</a> those in need.

    I live outside Boston with my wife and two children. I like <a href="https://www.davidcolarusso.com">drawing and painting</a>, playing with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com/post/3lfksaumajk2u" target="_blank">LEGO</a>, and fidgeting with Rubik's Cubes. On weekends my kids and I read the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com/post/3leywkp2xok2d" target="_blank">Sunday comics</a>, go on adventures <a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/@Colarusso/109371823932377084" target="_blank">in Minecraft</a>, and play the role of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com/post/3lwjo5kvrq22y" target="_blank">tiny-wildlife photographers</a> on walks around our neighborhood. To round out the "book jacket bio," I'm the author of a programing language for lawyers,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qnamarkup.org/" target="_blank">QnA Markup</a>, an  <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/hackathon_winners_look_to_increase_the_reach_of_their_apps" target="_blank">award-winning</a> legal hacker, 
<a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/david-a-colarusso" target="_blank">inventor</a>, 
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-colarusso/eagles-for-equality_b_1768515.html" target="_blank">Eagle Scout</a>,     
<a href="https://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/david_colarusso_profile" target="_blank">ABA Legal Rebel</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastcase.com/fastcase50/?class=2016" target="_blank">Fastcase 50 honoree</a>. Back when Twitter still existed, and before I left, the ABA thought I was a <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/best_law_twitter_web_100" target="_blank">good follow</a>, and I was briefly worth <a href="https://www.npr.org/2007/07/23/12169694/site-holds-vote-on-debate-questions" target="_blank">interviewing</a> about online political videos.

  <p>This website is a place for me to share some of my <a href="projects/#work">work</a> and <a href="projects/#play">play</a>, along with <a href="posts">thoughts<a href="projects/#play"></a> that don't fit nicely into a social media post. If you're looking to talk, or follow my work, I suggest finding me on Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com" target="_blank">@davidcolarusso.com</a>.

  <p class="footnotes"><sup>&dagger;</sup> My full name is David Anthony Colarusso, and in the twilight of the 20th Century when the internet and I were young, I entered my full name into an online anagram generator—hence this website's domain name. Sadly, even decades later, I still can't shake the image of some poor soul breaking the news to that dinosaur.</p>
